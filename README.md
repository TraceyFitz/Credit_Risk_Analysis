# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17 Challenge 


Overview of the analysis: Apply machine learning to solve credit card risk by employing different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

Results: All six models basically had the same balanced accuracy scores around .78. The confusion matrix also yeilded around the same scores of all six machine learning models.


Summary: I do not have a preference or recommendation on which model to use. They all seem to be around the same scores.
